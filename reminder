For next time you're having conflicts between branches, this is how you do it. 

Go to terminal.
Check "git status" to see what files need fixing
Do "git add" and then specifiy file name (i.e. BankAccount.java)
Do "git commit -m" and then add commit message in quotes
Do "git push" and push the files to the master branch.
